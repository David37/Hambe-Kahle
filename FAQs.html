    <h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2><br>
    
    <button class="accordion">How to make a booking with Hamba Kahle?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>You need to register an account on the Homepage of Hamba Kahle Transportation. Once, you have created an account then all of the services are available to you.
            There is a booking option that you need to click on to start your process. It will lead you to the booking form where you will have to fill in the necessary details.
            Please make sure that the information that you fill in is the correct details of your trip. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <button class="accordion">How much is it to make a booking?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            The amount that you will have to pay depends on the details of your trip. To explain further, the travel distance is mostly what your payment depends on. 
            Another factor that contributes to the price is the time of year that you are travelling in. Example, if it is during the festive or Easter season where demand for transportation service is high then price is likely to increase as well. 
            However, the total price remains affordable for our clients.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How do I make payment?</button>
